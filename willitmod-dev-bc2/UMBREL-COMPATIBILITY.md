# Umbrel packaging

Umbrel renders the top-level `docker-compose.yml.template` before installation
and every start. It refreshes top-level templates and `hooks/` on upgrades.
The generated template uses `hooks/umbrel-init` and `hooks/umbrel-ckpool` as
container entrypoints, so an older initializer preserved under `data/` cannot
block an upgraded Umbrel installation.

5tratumOS consumes `docker-compose.yml` directly. Its platform integration and
`data/init/init.sh` remain unchanged, including the minimum OS check. The DEV
0.1.14 recipe updates Umbrel export handling, gateway hostname discovery, and
the aligned application version. The Umbrel template needs no 5tratumOS host
file. Native and Umbrel recipes share the same pinned application and retain
the existing Core 31, CKPool, and initialization images.

The generated Umbrel initializer retains migration-marker validation, reindex
requirements, payout preservation, data ownership repair, and the persistent
application policy. The `.5tratumos-rollback-policy.json` filename is retained
because the app consumes it and it protects a later move to 5tratumOS.
Umbrel does not provide the 5tratumOS host rollback-policy enforcement API;
this package does not claim to add an Umbrel OS downgrade guard.

Regenerate after changing the shared recipe or initializer:

```sh
python3 scripts/build-axebc2-umbrel.py
python3 scripts/build-axebc2-umbrel.py --check
python3 scripts/validate-axebc2-core31-dev.py --phase finalized
```

Generated entrypoints live in `hooks/` because it is an upstream update
whitelist directory. They are non-executable on the host and are invoked
explicitly by `/bin/sh` inside their pinned containers. Shell programs must
not be embedded in the Compose template: Umbrel's `envsubst` would consume
their local shell variables before container startup.

Runtime validation target: a fresh umbrelOS 1.7.4 amd64 VM. The existing Core 31
acceptance record describes the original 0.1.11 5tratumOS recipe; it is not evidence
that the new Umbrel path has passed runtime testing.

## Initial packaging candidate 0.1.12 (superseded)

The initial MAIN packaging candidate used version 0.1.12 with the 0.1.11
application image. DEV published 0.1.12 with the BETA UI update: the general
release banner was removed and the compact badge retained. Release 0.1.13
supersedes both, aligning application and package versions in each channel.
Node and pool images are unchanged.

On 6 September 2026, both candidates passed the native installer and repeated
container initialization on 5tratumOS v0.7.12-dev at 10.10.10.235, using
isolated installation roots and disposable data. The original required mount
was also tested against an absent JSON source and reproduced the Docker bind
failure. Both generated Umbrel initializers passed without a host JSON bind.

The isolated DEV node, pool, and app started; the app page and node API
responded, including after restarting the app. That smoke test used localhost
access, resource limits, and no blockchain peer connections. It does not
establish synchronized mining or Umbrel dashboard authentication.

Automated validation: 33 DEV tests and 40 MAIN tests passed. Real Umbrel
installation, authenticated opening, and upgrade remain pending VM access.

The BETA application candidate is bound in `BETA-RELEASE-EVIDENCE.json`.
Historical Core 31 acceptance remains tied to 0.1.11. Validation permits only
the explicit BETA application-image and stage changes relative to that recipe;
any other change to the native recipe fails the baseline hash check.

## Aligned release 0.1.13

Application and package versions now align: 0.1.13-dev in DEV and 0.1.13 in
MAIN. Both use the same tested application digest with channel-specific image
tags. Core 31, CKPool, the native initializer, and persistent data paths retain
their accepted configuration. Historical 0.1.11/0.1.12 observations above remain
bound to those releases. See RELEASE-0.1.13-EVIDENCE.json for this release.

## Umbrel 2 installer repair 0.1.14-dev

Umbrel sources `exports.sh` under its own strict shell settings before it renders
`docker-compose.yml.template`. Release 0.1.14-dev makes missing legacy auth
containers an expected lookup result and does not alter the caller's shell
options. It retains a supplied or discovered real `JWT_SECRET` for legacy
Umbrel authentication. When no legacy auth service exists, it leaves the secret
unset instead of fabricating one; Umbrel 2's in-process app gateway does not
consume this legacy Compose value. The generated Umbrel recipe also declares
the unique `axebc2-app` hostname. Umbrel 2 can therefore resolve the authenticated
gateway target and register the manifest's LAN port without relying on a Docker
network alias that its ingress resolver does not inspect.

The final package pairs this repair with a separately built and verified
0.1.14-dev application image so the app UI and package versions remain aligned.
BitcoinII Core 31.1, CKPool, Alpine, persistent paths, and migration safeguards
remain unchanged.

Real lifecycle validation on 6 September 2026 used Umbrel 2.0.0-beta.1 on an
amd64 VM. The failed 0.1.13 install was reproduced, repaired, installed, and then
upgraded through Umbrel's own app-update API to the 0.1.14 candidate digest.
Unauthenticated requests redirect to Umbrel login; normal owner authentication
opens the dashboard and all tested node/pool/widget APIs successfully.

This new Core 31 chain had no accepted migration-completion record. Its first
upgrade therefore ran the existing full-reindex safeguard and completed with
checkpoint and chainwork verification. This release does not bypass that check.
Installations without a valid completion record can still reindex; already
completed migrations retain their record. Node and pool configuration were
preserved. No payout address was configured on this new VM, so actual mining
and share submission were not exercised. See RELEASE-0.1.14-EVIDENCE.json for
precise validation scope and results; older observations above are historical.
